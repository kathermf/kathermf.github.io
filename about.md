Hello!

My name is Katherine Fitzpatrick and I am a programmer, game designer, and artist. I recently graduated from the University of California Irvine with a major in Computer Game Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. As you may have guessed, I am passionate about both playing and making games. I have enjoyed all sorts of games and genres, though I am particularly fond of multiplayer games that can be enjoyed with others. When it comes to game development, I am constantly thinking of ways to create or improve upon game concepts or mechanics that could potentially become a part of a game. Many of the projects that I have worked on have given me valuable experience with working on a team. I have helped develop games for both PC and mobile, and am interested in developing for other platforms such as console and virtual reality.

If you would like to check out the projects I've worked on or are looking to hire, you can take a look at my resume and portfolio on this site. Thanks for stopping by!
