## Selfie Surf
<img align="right" src="images/selfiesurf0_1.png" width="200">

Platform(s): Android, iOS

> 2nd Place Winner for Best Game Showing Commercial Viability in the IEEE GameSIG 2017 Showcase

Selfie Surf is a single-device party game for mobile, inspired by the game "Telephone." Players start with a random word or phrase and then take a selfie-based on that word. They then hand the phone to the next player, who enters a word or phrase based on that selfie. They hand the phone to the next player, who takes another selfie until everyone has taken a turn. All players can now watch an animated sequence of everyone's pictures coupled with the words and see what's lost (or gained!) in translation. The game supports 4-16 players.

Platform(s): PC

The player must listen carefully for when the monster is approaching and utilize the tables to hide from the monster. Additionally, the player must avoid the squeaky cracks on the ground that attract the monster and listen for the paths that will eventually lead them to the child's dog, or face a grisly death.

## Edgewin
<img align="right" src="images/edgewin0.png" width="200">
Platform(s): PC

This game is a action-based third-person shooter, though with unique mechanics (and a really silly premise) that makes it unique from other shooters. The Edgewin is on a journey through outer space to collect as many edgey items, upgrade his edge powers, and become the ultimate Edgelord. Along the way, he must deal with slowly draining health and avoid all manner of obstacles, including hunters, meteors, and really annoying shooting stars. 

This game was originally made for the VGDC Spring 2017 Game Jam, in which the theme given was "not enough edges." Additionally, the game's silly premise came from a series of in-jokes concerning friend of the team and then VGDC President Edwin Ho.

## Defier
<img align="right" src="images/defier0.png" width="200">
Platform(s): Card Game

Defier is an adventure card game set in Ancient Rome and inspired by the gameplay of the classic arcade game, PacMan. Each player selects one of four Roman heroes with unique abilities and compete against one another to slay the twin gods Apollo and Diana. Players create their own game field as they play with Exploration Cards and make their way to the center of the play field, in which they face off in an epic battle against the gods. Along the way, players slay the twin gods’ minions and explore monuments and dungeons, attaining greater power through gaining levels and collecting items.

The twin gods Apollo and Diana have forsaken your people and are bent on destroying Rome! They have conjured a disheveled copy of Rome underground and whatever damage is dealt to the structures there will be reflected onto the original. The mirrored city is riddled with creatures and horrors known only by man’s tongue for anyone foolish enough to raise their sword against the gods. The emperor of Rome makes a royal decree to slay the Gods, sending only but his four finest warriors - Iovita, Blinkus, Prisca and Claudius to the underworld to slay the gods and reclaim Rome’s former glory.
