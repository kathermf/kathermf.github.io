Platform(s): Android, iOS

> Won second place for Best Game in the IEEE GameSIG 2017 Showcase

Selfie Surf is a single-device party game for mobile, inspired by the game "Telephone." Players start with a random word or phrase and then take a selfie-based on that word. They then hand the phone to the next player, who enters a word or phrase based on that selfie. They hand the phone to the next player, who takes another selfie until everyone has taken a turn. All players can now watch an animated sequence of everyone's pictures coupled with the words and see what's lost (or gained!) in translation. The game supports 4-16 players.

To make matters worse, a monster knows the child is there and is trying to hunt them down. The player must listen carefully for when the monster is approaching and utilize the tables to hide from the monster. Additionally, the player must avoid the squeaky cracks on the ground that attract the monster and listen for the paths that will eventually lead them to the child's dog, or face a grisly death.

## Edgewin
<img align="right" src="images/edgewin0.png" width="200">
Platform(s): PC

This game is a action-based third-person shooter, though with unique mechanics (and a really silly premise) that makes it unique from other shooters. The Edgewin is on a journey through outer space to collect as many edgey items, upgrade his edge powers, and become the ultimate Edgelord. Along the way, he must deal with slowly draining health and avoid all manner of obstacles, including hunters, meteors, and really annoying shooting stars. 

This game was originally made for the VGDC Spring 2017 Game Jam, in which the theme given was "not enough edges." Additionally, the game's silly premise came from in-jokes concerning then VGDC President Edwin Ho.
