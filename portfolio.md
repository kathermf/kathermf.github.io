<img align="right" src="images/abitd0.png" width="200">
Team Project | Platform(s): PC

A short survival horror game where the player must listen to avoid danger. In this game, the main character is a young child trying to find their pet dog while wandering haunted hallways in the dark. To make matters worse, a monster knows the child is there and is trying to hunt them down. The player must listen carefully for when the monster is approaching and utilize the tables to hide from the monster. Additionally, the player must avoid the squeaky cracks on the ground that attract the monster and listen for the paths that will eventually lead them to the child's dog, or face a grisly death.

Team Project | Platform(s): [PC](https://xuanf1.itch.io/edgewin-the-game)

This game is a action-based third-person shooter, though with unique mechanics (and a really silly premise) that makes it unique from other shooters. The Edgewin is on a journey through outer space to collect as many edgey items, upgrade his edge powers, and become the ultimate Edgelord. Along the way, he must deal with slowly draining health and avoid all manner of obstacles, including hunters, meteors, and really annoying shooting stars.
