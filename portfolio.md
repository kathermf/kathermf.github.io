Platform(s): Android, iOS

* Won second place for Best Game in the IEEE GameSIG 2017 Showcase

Selfie Surf is a single-device party game for mobile, inspired by the game "Telephone." Players start with a random word or phrase and then take a selfie-based on that word. They then hand the phone to the next player, who enters a word or phrase based on that selfie. They hand the phone to the next player, who takes another selfie until everyone has taken a turn. All players can now watch an animated sequence of everyone's pictures coupled with the words and see what's lost (or gained!) in translation. The game supports 4-16 players.
