## About
Platform(s): Android

Pan Fried Panic is a 2 VS 2 frantic cooking game in which the goal is to prepare food faster than the other team. This is accomplished through fast-paced minigames requiring the coordination of both players on your team to set up. The game currently features baking cakes and the first team to work together to bake three cakes the fastest wins.

Developed as a part of the Capstone course for the Computer Game Science Major at the University of California.
