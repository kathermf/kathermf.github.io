## About
Team Project | Platform(s): PC
A short, story-focused role-playing game set in a dark, cyberpunk world. In a dystopian future, the surface of the world has been nearly rendered unlivable due to pollution and climate change. People must hide away in structures and rely on the virtual world Haven in order to communicate and function. Additionally, a war is brewing between the corrupted company running Haven and the rebellion trying to bring them down. Jayden, an ordinary citizen with a talent for computer hacking, is thrust in the middle of this war when he is forced to take desperate actions to save his beloved Sloane, who requires medication to keep the poisonous effects of using Haven at bay.

Originally made for a course at UCI. This course emphasized narrative and its portrayal in computer games.

## Contribution
#### Programming
I was the main programmer in charge of implementing the gameplay of the game.

#### Game Design
The entire team worked out the design of the game. Because I was in charge of implementing many parts of the game, I had a major contribution to the design.
