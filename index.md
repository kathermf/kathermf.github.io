## What Am I Up To?

#### Deducing Deduction 
##### September 2017
I can't say much about this at the moment, except that it has to do with logic puzzles, AI, and a beloved fictional character. This particular project is still undergoing testing to see if the concept is viable. Of course, I'll make a demo and see what other people think of it before making any promises.

#### Couch Co-op Comeback 
##### August 2017
I've been experimenting with 3D controls and controller input with Unity, lately, in the hopes of getting more experience with 3D, 3rd person game mechanics, and console game development. Inspired by my childhood and awesome games like Overcooked, I plan to develop local co-op games for me and my friends to enjoy. And since Microsoft has so graciously blessed us developers with [some help](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/creators-program), these games are likely to actually be published on a console!

#### Royal Dilemma
##### July 2017
One of the games I've played recently  included a really cool empire-manager feature. However, I found the mechanics with this manager were a bit lacking (which is understandable, given that the game's focus wasn't solely on that feature). Noting the interesting bits and parts where such a feature could improve made the rusty creative gears in my head start grinding and so I've started designing the kind of kingdom management game that I would like to play.

## About Me

<img align="right" src="images/untitled.JPG" width="150">
Hello!

My name is Katherine Fitzpatrick and I am a programmer and game designer. I recently graduated from the University of California Irvine with a major in Computer Game Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. As you may have guessed, I am passionate about both playing and making games. I have enjoyed all sorts of games and genres, though I am particularly fond of multiplayer games that can be enjoyed with others. When it comes to game development, I am constantly thinking of ways to create or improve upon game concepts or mechanics that could potentially become a part of a game. Many of the projects that I have worked on have given me valuable experience with working on a team. I have helped develop games for both PC and mobile, and am interested in developing for other platforms such as console and virtual reality.

If you would like to check out the projects I've worked on or are looking to hire, you can take a look at my resume and portfolio on this site. Thanks for stopping by!
