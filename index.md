## About Me
<img align="right" src="images/untitled.JPG" width="150">
Hello!

My name is Katherine Fitzpatrick and I am a programmer and game designer. I recently graduated from the University of California Irvine with a major in Computer Game Science. As you may have guessed, I am passionate about both playing and making games. I have enjoyed all sorts of games and genres, though I am particularly fond of multiplayer games that can be enjoyed with others. 

If you want to check out the projects I've worked on or are looking to hire, you can take a look at my resume and portfolio on this site. Thanks for stopping by!

## Current Project(s) 
I am currently working on personal projects while looking out for potential jobs.

### Selfie Surf
I recently went to an IEEE OCCS meeting to give a presentation on Selfie Surf along with the rest of ABI Productions. There, the team discussed some features that will potentially make their way into the app.
