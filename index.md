## About Me
Hello!

My name is Katherine Fitzpatrick and I am a programmer and game designer. I recently graduated from the University of California Irvine with a major in Computer Game Science. As you may have guessed, I am passionate about both playing and making games. I have enjoyed all sorts of games and genres, though I am particularly fond of multiplayer games that can be enjoyed with others. 

If you want to check out the projects I've worked on or are looking to hire, feel free to take a look at my resume and portfolio on this site. Thanks for stopping by!

## Current Project(s) 
I am currently working on personal projects while looking out for potential jobs.
