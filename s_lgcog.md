## About
Solo Project | Platform(s): PC
A 3D first person exploration puzzle game. The player plays an archaeologist explorer traversing a desert canyon along with their (green) archaeologist team in search of the Lost Gold City of Gold. The player must search for the keys in order to unlock the golden gate that may lead to the City, doing simple platforming puzzles in order to obtain them. Interacting with the other members of the team gives the player hints as to where to go or how to obtain certain keys.

Originally made for a course at UCI. This course emphasized the creation of 3D models. All the models in the game were custom created using Autodesk Maya.
