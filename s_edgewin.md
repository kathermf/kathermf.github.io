## About
Platform(s): PC

This game is a action-based third-person shooter, though with unique mechanics (and a really silly premise) that makes it unique from other shooters. The Edgewin is on a journey through outer space to collect as many edgey items, upgrade his edge powers, and become the ultimate Edgelord. Along the way, he must deal with slowly draining health and avoid all manner of obstacles, including hunters, meteors, and really annoying shooting stars. 

This game was originally made for the VGDC Spring 2017 Game Jam, in which the theme given was "not enough edges." Additionally, the game's silly premise came from a series of in-jokes concerning friend of the team and then VGDC President Edwin Ho.
